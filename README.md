# Student Performance Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts student academic performance based on key input features.  
This project applies supervised learning techniques to classify/predict performance outcomes.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Training multiple machine learning models  
- Performance evaluation with accuracy metrics  
- Predicts likelihood of student success  

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-Learn (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## How It Works
1. Collects and cleans dataset (student demographics, study habits, etc.)  
2. Splits data into training and testing sets  
3. Trains models and compares results  
4. Generates predictions on new/unseen data  

## Future Improvements
- Integrate deep learning models for higher accuracy  
- Build a user-friendly dashboard with Power BI or Streamlit
